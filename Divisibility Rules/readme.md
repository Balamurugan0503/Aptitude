Use these rules to quickly check if a number is divisible without long division.

| Divisible By | Rule                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2            | If the last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)                             |
| 3            | If the sum of the digits is divisible by 3                           |
| 4            | If the last two digits form a number divisible by 4                  |
| 5            | If the number ends in 0 or 5                                         |
| 6            | If the number is divisible by both 2 **and** 3                       |
| 7            | Double the last digit, subtract it from the rest. If divisible by 7  |
| 8            | If the last three digits form a number divisible by 8                |
| 9            | If the sum of digits is divisible by 9                               |
| 10           | If the number ends in 0                                              |
| 11           | If the alternating sum of digits is divisible by 11                  |
| 12           | If divisible by both 3 **and** 4                                     |
